Okay  so  they began with  like  a dream sequence of  um  a shootout  It  during the day  It looks like its in a grassy field with some sort of disheveled  like  half decomposed building  Um  there  a lot of guys in army gear  um  shooting  It  very chaotic  can  really make out any faces  or  really people  Um  and then  so  that  uh  cuts out really quickly and you see this man kind of like start out of the bed  It  dark  Looks like it  the middle of the night or something  And  um  so he just kind of sits up  and  like  sits there  like  heaving for a while  like he just woke up from a nightmare which is what we assume that dream was  Um  so then it cuts out to the daytime and we get  like  an image of his apartment and kind of  like  walking around  They have a shot of his mug which has some kind of  like  sign on it  like a crest almost  And then  um  there   like  a quick shot too of a gun and a notebook  And then it cuts to another clip of the same man sitting in front of what we can assume is his therapist  And  um  they  talking  She says something about him still having trust issues  and or no  she writes that  and then he reads it upside down and asks her  like  about writing that  and then  um  she confronts him about reading her writing upside down  and it  a very tense situation  And then  um  that immediately cuts out and we see a blonde woman  Um  she  in an office building  She  on the phone with a man  And  um  we  not sure what the relationship is between her and the man  but  uh  she tells him to get a taxi home  And then  um  right after we see a clip of a man taking a pill out of  like  this clear bottle  And  um  the pill is white with red dots on it  And the  the scene is pretty hazy so you  not exactly sure what  happening  Looks like he  in some sort of  uh  building though  like right up against the edge in  like  a glass elevator or some small  confined area  So he  shaking  he takes his pill  and then  um  we see him press against the glass from an outside perspective  And later  it revealed that he died  Um  and it  implied that that pill is the poison that killed him  And  um  then there  a quick scene where  uh  someone  I  not sure who it was  was saying  um  this man  like  he was a good person  we  not sure why he died  or  I mean  why he would have committed suicide  And then the blonde woman who spoke to him on the phone earlier is seen in the background crying  And then we cut to another scene of these two teenagers  maybe early twenties  these two guys  pretty young  um  walking in the rain  One of them doesn  have his umbrella  and the other does  And it  raining  it  dark  it  in the evening  The one without the umbrella tells his friend   I  gonna go back and get my umbrella   because it  raining  And then  so  he leaves  and  um  again  it  kind of unclear exactly what happens  But  the friend was waiting for awhile  we can assume that because he checks his watch a couple times  and then  uh  the guy  the same bottle that the man had earlier with the pills in it  that appears again and we assume that the  um  that the guy who walked away supposedly to get an umbrella  took this pill and then  um  died  Then there is another scene with two  um  it looks like it  in a club or something  there  a bar  A woman walks out of the club dance floor area and says to a man   Hey she  still dancing  if you can call it that   Um  and then  um  these two  or  actually just kidding that  the end of those two characters  And then  uh  we see the woman  assuming she  the one that those two characters are talking about  and she has  she also has these  um  pills  and takes one out of the same vial again  and is dead  I believe then we go to  um  a panel  Uh  it looks like a press conference  and we  not sure exactly who the characters are on the panel but they seem to be some sort of public safety  police chief kind of figures  And  uh  there  pictures of the three suicide victims  um  as a backdrop  There  a man and a woman who are really speaking  or are important in this scene  The man is mostly talking  He  saying things like   These suicides are definitely linked  Uh  It was the same poison that killed all of them   Um  the  uh  he does say some things  though  he says  I believe  um  like   We have our best people on the team   and then everyone in the room gets a text that just says  wrong   that  it   Wrong   exclamation mark  And then later he says  um oh  later there  a woman in the audience who asks   If these suicides are linked  how do we know they  not murder?  And then the  the man responds  saying   Well  they  obviously suicides  because the manner  like the pills were obviously self administered   And then he says  like  in short or  the woman asks   How can we  uh  prevent this happening   and he almost brushes it off saying  Well  don  commit suicide   And then he says  um  something along the lines of I  paraphrasing  but you guys  everyone is as safe as they want to be  And then  again  the  everyone gets a text saying  wrong   And that  the third time that text is sent  And then a text is sent to only the man who was speaking  Um  uh  oh I  not sure I remember what it said  but it was signed S  H   which we can assume is Sherlock Holmes  Um  let  see  and then  um  I believe we go to  go back to  um  uh  Watson  which was the man who had the nightmare earlier  and he  walking around what looks like a university area  Um  he meets this other guy  um  not exactly sure what his role is either  but this older man  and they sit and talk for awhile  they  having coffee  Um  oh  I never mentioned earlier  but  so Watson  he has a  uh  his leg is injured  so he walks with a cane and with a bit of a limp  Um  but yeah  so he and this man that he met are now sitting on a bench just talking um there  another scene where we see uh Sherlock the scene opens with the camera as if the camera was a cadaver so the camera  like looking up and Watson unzips this  um  the  the bag and then is looking down at the camera and that  when you first see it  you have  or sorry  Sherlock unzips it  looks down  that  when we first see him  And he has this other  there  this other lady with him  I  assuming  or  I  assuming she  the assistant  And  so  um  we see him take  like  I  not sure what it  called  like one of those paddle things  and  like  whacks this body pretty furiously for quite a while  Um  he says something about  like  checking how the bruises form to his assistant  and then she  um  starts to ask him for coffee  He interrupts her saying that she had put on lipstick  She looks embarrassed  um  but then ends up finishing  asking if he wants coffee  and then he says   Yes   He goes up to his lab where he  working on something  It looks like he  using  like  a pipette or something to  uh  work with fluids  She  um  delivers to him his coffee and he makes a remark that she now has removed her lipstick  And she again looks kind of embarrassed  says something about it not working out for her  And  um  excuse me  um  he  um  starts  says something along the lines of   Oh  like  it was an improvement   or something   your lips look small now   And then she leaves  she  but hurt  Um  while this is happening  he had just met  uh  Watson  So  Watson and his friend from earlier  um  approached Sherlock in his lab  and  uh  maybe one of the first things Sherlock says to Watson is  um   So  what was it  Iraq or Afghanistan?  So  he immediately knows that Watson was an army doctor  He makes some mention of that later  also saying  like   I know you  an army doctor   Um  the  it  revealed that Sherlock is looking for a flat mate and this mutual friend  um  is now going to introduce Watson to Sherlock in hopes that  um  Sherlock and  or  Watson will be a suitable roommate for Watson  So  um  that happens  Uh  Sherlock asks for the mutual friend  phone  and he doesn  have it  so Watson offers up his  Um  Sherlock appears to send a text or something through his phone  um  and then before  uh  those two leave  meaning  um  Watson and his friend  Sherlock says   Meet me at the address two two one Baker Street   I think  um  because that  where his flat is going to be  And then  um  Watson kind of says something along the lines of   But we don  even know each other   and then Sherlock starts listing things  He says  um  that Watson was an army doctor in Afghanistan  and that  um  his  he  not close to his brother  His brother recently  like  walked out of a marriage or something  or is an alcoholic  or both  And  um uh Watson looks very confused or shocked  I guess  at this  And then  um  he leaves  So  um  and then I believe we see the two of them now and they  um  get  or they are now entering what we can assume is Sherlock  flat  Um  there  another lady  the landlord  Um  I forgot her name  but she  also there with them  and greets them both  Um  we see that Sherlock  flat is a complete mess  Uh  there  books  things  there  this skull poster on the wall  there  another actual skull sitting above the fireplace  Uh  the kitchen  a mess  it looks like there  lots of  like  chemistry lab equipment on there  Um  but yeah  so then  uh  they go into there  and then  there  they talk for a little bit  Um  Sherlock  uh  he  he makes some comments about  to  um  his landlady about  um  having her make him tea or clean up the kitchen or something along those lines  And she  kind of protesting   I am not like a housekeeper  I  the landlord here   But  um  yeah  he  they uh  talk about the three linked suicides  I believe prompted by a newspaper  And then  uh  while they  talking about it  Sherlock looks out the window and says well now it  four  So  somehow he sees a police car and just immediately knows that it   that means that there has been a suicide  Oh  um  yeah  so before this scene  there was another one of those unclear  fuzzy suicide scenes where we see a woman with bright red nails reaching for yet again that same pill bottle with those pills in it  And then  um  so we can assume that she committed suicide in the same manner  So  um  so  back to the Sherlock  um  flat scene  He  looking out the window  he says   This time it  unusual  though  Um  number four is  this is different   So  not long after he says this  there  a man who comes up the stairs into Sherlock  flat  Um  I  call him  like  the invest  or police investigator from here on out  just for clarity  sake  So  the policeman  um  he doesn  even say anything to Sherlock  I don  think  before Sherlock says like  um  like   What  different about this case?  And then he asks   Why?  Like   Why do you think something  different?  And then Sherlock says   Well  if there wasn  anything different  you wouldn  have come to me   Um  something along those lines  And then  um  the policeman says  uh   They you know how they never leave a note? They left a note   So  um  he leaves after  or  no  he asks Sherlock   Will you come?  And then Sherlock kind of nonchalantly says  like   I be out behind you   And then  so  the policeman leaves  Um  Sherlock is suddenly  like  bursts out  he  really excited  He says   This is so much fun   and  um  quickly goes after him  Um  so now  in the flat  there  just the landlady and Watson left  And then  um  Watson asks for tea and biscuits  and the landlady says to him what she said earlier to Sherlock about not being a housekeeper  Um  Sherlock now reappears really quickly and then there   like  a witty exchange between him and Watson  Sherlock says  um   You  a doctor  I  sure you  seen lots of like gruesome  violent things   And then  uh  Watson says   Yeah   like   More than enough  more than  more than you can imagine   And then Sherlock says   Want to see more?  And then Watson replies affirmatively  and those two go to the scene of the crime  Um  on the way there  they have a conversation in the cab  where  um  Watson asks Sherlock about how he knew everything about  uh  having  about Watson having  like  an estrange   estrange   estranged brother  who left his wife  and  or is alcoholic  and how he knew that he was an army doctor from Afghanistan  Um  so  Sherlock explains everything  I didn  catch every little detail he said  but even the little  like  he says the way that Watson walked  the scratches on his phone  the fact that his phone was a hand me down  and the engraving on the back of his phone  And then  so  Watson is very thoroughly impressed  and Sherlock is almost surprised by that  because  he said that most people get angry  Um  and then  as they  leaving the cab  Watson  or  Sherlock asks Watson what he got wrong  And then  so  Watson starts listing off everything exactly as Sherlock had said it  And Sherlock was like  is  was pleasantly surprised  saying like   Wow  well  for once I got everything right   And then Watson says   Well  Harry is short for Harriet   So  um  Sherlock was actually wrong about the gender of  uh  Watson  sibling; it wasn  his brother  it was his sister  Um  so  they arrive at the scene of the crime  Um  there  police tape everywhere  It  at night  There is  uh  police cars  the sirens  It looks like a pretty old run down apartment building  Um  the two are greeted by this lady  she  wearing  like  a peacoat and a skirt  and then there  some animosity between this lady and Sherlock  Um  it seems like they had some history of some sort; they don  like each other  Uh  she calls him  the freak   And  um  uh  yeah  there   like  a tense interaction there  He asks  uh  why  or he makes a comment about her not having come home last night and still wearing the same thing from the night before  And then  so  they duck under  There  this guy named Anderson who comes out  who we know does not get along too well with Sherlock and maybe doesn  quite believe in his abilities  detective ability  So  um  Anderson says to him  just some snarky things to him; I don  remember exactly what  And  um  uh  Sherlock makes a comment about the lady  um  spending the night at  with Anderson  um  because of the cologne that he can smell  or something  And then also makes a comment about her knees  um  implying that  like  there was some sexual relationship going on  And  so  then  he  he Sherlock and Watson enter the building
